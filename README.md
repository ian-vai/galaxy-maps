# galaxy-map

This is an open source project that enables educators to map their curriculums into a "galaxy map".
Students can then navigate the curriculum in an individualised, self-paced, gamified way.

It is being created primarily for use at Tai WƒÅnanga secondary schools in Aotearoa: https://www.taiwananga.co.nz/

The concept was inspired by 42's education model and Intra platform: https://www.42.us.org/
