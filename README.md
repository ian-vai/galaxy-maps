# galaxy-maps

This project enables kaiako (teachers) to map their curriculums into a "Galaxy Map".
Taiohi (students) can then navigate the curriculum in an individualised, self-paced, gamified way.

Like their ancestors that used the stars to navigate the seas, using these Galaxy Maps taiohi can navigate their learning.

This is a work in progress, being created primarily for use at Tai WƒÅnanga secondary schools in Aotearoa: https://www.taiwananga.co.nz/

The concept was inspired by 42's education model and Intra platform: https://www.42.us.org/
